Hello, I am a postdoctoral scholar at The Ohio State University working to better understand human brain. My research focused on the interactions between `visual perception`, `attention` and `eye movements`, especially how these cognitive systems work in dynamic environments. 

I used a variety of methodologies including `human behavioral tasks`, `neuroimaging (EEG and fMRI)`, `machine learning` and `computational models`.

I completed my Ph.D. in 2021 at The Ohio State University advised by [Dr. Julie Golomb](https://u.osu.edu/golomblab/){:target="\_blank"}. Before coming to OSU, I was a master student and a research assistant in [Dr. Marisa Carrascoâ€™s Lab](https://carrascolab.hosting.nyu.edu){:target="\_blank"} at New York University.
